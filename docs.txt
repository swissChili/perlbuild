TITLE
    perlbuild

DESCRIPTION
    A generic build tool written in perl

  USAGE
    gfc->new(source)
        This function creates a new instance of the GCC Builder class. The
        returned instance has several methods useful for compiling generic
        programs. Source is used as an initial source file

    gfc->link(library)
        Adds a dynamic library to the list of libs to link. This, like all
        methods in perlbuild does not actually build when it is called, but
        rather set up parameters for a build method to use later. See
        "static" or "build" for more info.
